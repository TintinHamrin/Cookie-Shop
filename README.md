### ***👨‍🎓 Learnings***

Got a deeper understanding of general programming patterns and developed my understanding of Typescript and how to use it on both the front- and backend.

Learned how to set up and incorporate a backend server to frontend using Node.js/Express.

Developed my understanding of noSQL databases and ODM using MongoDB and Mongoose. Developed my knowledge of React and how to manage state globally over an app (using Redux Toolkit). Developed my understanding of managing a fullstack app and using NextJS.

I've used Material UI for design and accessability concerns and SCSS when needing to override styles. 

The app is bootstrapped with Create react App.
