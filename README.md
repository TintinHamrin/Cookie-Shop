<b>👨‍🎓 Learnings:</b><br>
Got a deeper understanding of general programming patterns and developed my understanding of Typescript and how to use it on both the front- and backend. <br>
Learned how to set up and incorporate a backend server to frontend using Node.js/Express. <br>
Developed my understanding of noSQL databases (MongoDB and Firebase). Developed my knowledge of React and how to manage state globally over an app (using Redux Toolkit).<br> I've used Material UI for design and accessability concerns and SCSS when needing to override styles.
