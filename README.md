Got a deeper understanding of general programming patterns and developed my understanding of Typescript and how to use it on both the front- and backend.

Learned how to set up and incorporate a backend server to frontend using Node.js/Express.

Developed my understanding of noSQL databases (MongoDB and Firebase). Developed my knowledge of React and how to manage state globally over an app (using Redux Toolkit).
