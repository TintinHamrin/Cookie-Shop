Got a deeper understanding of general programming patterns and developed my understanding of Typescript and how to use it on both the front- and backend.

Developed my understanding of noSQL databases and ORM using MongoDB and Papr. Developed my knowledge of React and how to manage state globally over an app (using Redux Toolkit). Developed my understanding of managing a fullstack app. Deepened my understanding of sessions and session middleware, learned about Redis for session storing and caching.
